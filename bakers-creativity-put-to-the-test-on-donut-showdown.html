Cooking Channel photo</p><p>Calling doughnuts her <span class=quotations>“preferred canvas”</span> as an artist, a Maui baker’s upcoming appearance on Cooking Channel’s <span class=quotations>“Donut Showdown”</span> offers her the chance to win $10,000 as well as the opportunity to show the world she can <span class=quotations>“turn the humble donut into Cinderella.”</span></p><p>Madame Donut — which Desiree Parada prefers to be called and has registered as a legal name — is the owner of Donut Dynamite in Wailuku. After three years of selling their doughnuts at the Maui Swap Meet, Fourth Fridays in Kihei and a few retail locations around the island, she and husband Frank Parada opened their brick-and-mortar bakery in August in the former Manapua Bakery at 1246 Lower Main St.</p><p>On <span class=quotations>“Donut Showdown,”</span> she faces two other doughnut makers in time-limited challenges featuring a theme and secret ingredient. The winner receives $10,000. According to Cooking Channel’s website, beer is the mystery ingredient in the backyard barbecue-themed episode featuring Madame Donut, which airs at 5 p.m. Tuesday on Oceanic Time Warner Cable Channels 322 and 1322. The episode will air again at 9 p.m. Tuesday.</p><p>While unable to discuss the specifics of the episode, Madame Donut said via email last week that competing on the show <span class=quotations>“was a complete switch in my approach of donut making.”</span> While she enjoys themes, time constraints scare her <span class=quotations>“because I don’t have much time to correct mistakes.”</span></p><p>At her Wailuku bakery, Madame Donut specializes in brioche doughnuts, which are <span class=quotations>“enriched with more eggs and butter.”</span> But, in the <span class=quotations>“Donut Showdown”</span> kitchen, <span class=quotations>“the time constraint automatically meant I cannot make my donuts because brioche takes a long time to make, so I had to resort to batters and doughs that I had not worked with before.”</span></p><img width=600 height=783 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2016/11/07054833/donut-showdown-1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Donut Dynamite’s Madame Donut is featured on Cooking Channel’s “Donut Showdown” on Tuesday. Cooking Channel photo</p><p><span class=quotations>“I am not used to using hoppers as I don’t usually make cake donuts, so I felt so out of place and even clumsy,”</span> she said. <span class=quotations>“I just resorted to creativity.”</span></p><p><span class=quotations>“I knew I didn’t want to make anything basic. I always wanted to push the envelope. I thought that if I couldn’t make my own donuts, I should at least have fun. So I did.”</span></p><p>Back on Maui since taping the show in Toronto, Madame Donut is busy with Donut Dynamite, which is now a full-time venture.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It has taken over my whole life!”</span> she said.</p><p>Donut Dynamite opens at 7 a.m. Monday through Saturday but regularly sells out of doughnuts — with a variety of flavors including bacon maple, Molokai sweet potato poi, Gimme S’more and Cheesy Hammy — by 10 a.m. (The bakery is closed Sundays, but preorders are available for pickup.)</p><p><span class=quotations>“It is simply physically impossible for me and my husband . . . to produce more than what we currently make,”</span> said Madame Donut, who grew up in the Philippines and graduated from the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in California’s Napa Valley. <span class=quotations>“We hope that, when we expand our menu and train the new staff, we can stay open until 2 p.m. The idea is that we (will) make donuts throughout service hours so there are fresh donuts no matter what time you come in.”</span></p><p>Despite the growing pains, <span class=quotations>“I’d like to continue doing what I love,”</span> she said of her passion for the pastries, and she hopes Tuesday’s TV appearance will <span class=quotations>“help us to keep moving forward by bringing in more patrons that we haven’t reached. And since it’s on national television, I imagine we would reach people beyond Maui!”</span></p><p>* Leah Sherman can be reached at lsherman@mauinews.com.</p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a><p>The Maui News Maui County Department of Finance Director Scott Teruya was placed on administrative leave on last ...</p><a href=#></a><p>Holy Innocents Episcopal Church, formerly on Front Street in Lahaina Town and destroyed by the fire, announced the ...</p><a href=#></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3UoqWer6NjsLC5jqecsKtfobykrctmpZ6vo2R%2FcX2VaGhqZ5KWuKa%2B0maaq52Rqba3tdOyZKmtpGLBsHnToZxmrJWowW67zWabqKalqXq0tM6wm6ivnmQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./selena-gomez-necklace-only-murders-in-the-building.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shop Selena Gomez's Rellery Necklace From 'Only Murders in the Building'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-we-did-on-our-holiday-2015.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What We Did on Our Holiday movie review (2015)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./latest-fantasy-news-a-peter-pan-wendy-stars-superman-near-miss-shocks-fans-as-viewers-plunge-into-a-bigger-and-bolder-new-season-of-sweet-tooth.html>Latest Fantasy News: A Peter Pan &amp;amp; Wendy stars Superman near-miss shocks fans as viewers pl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./roger-m-bobb-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Roger M.
