Now some people question his sexuality because of the many stories he has revealed and the controversial off-court actions he has done. But during his playing career, Rodman was dating some of the finest women. It is a long list of the several relationships he has had and the <strong>Los Angeles Lakers</strong> owner, <strong>Jeanie Buss</strong> also features in it.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dennis Rodman</a> joined the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1999 season. At that time he was also dating <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeanie Buss</a>. Just after his arrival in La La Land, he was the new superstar of the city. But unfortunately, the superstar duo of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shaquille O’Neal</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kobe Bryant</a> weren’t a fan of this addition. And, after suiting up for 23 games and donning the purple and yellow jersey Rodman was released during the offseason.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Dennis Rodman in his recent interview with VLADTV, revealed the reason behind his disappointing and unsuccessful run with the Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal-led Los Angeles Lakers. The 5× NBA champ talking about his time there quoted: “It was hard because I knew the fact that Shaq and Kobe wouldn’t like me. Jerry Buss, he loved me…I used to date his, uh, daughter. I was dating his daughter at the time and we dated for like six months.”</p><p>Further, revealing the big reason behind Shaq and Kobe not liking him, Dennis Rodman added: “Kobe and Shaq wouldn’t like me because a whole attention became Dennis. It shifted from them to me quickly. I mean you can see it in the stands, see it in the city and stuff like that… I am like I am not trying to do anything. They would rarely talk to me, even in games and stuff. That’s the main reason why they cut me. I think they went to the upper head and they didn’t want me there anymore.”</p><p>The trio would have surely done wonders with the right chemistry. And, Dennis Rodman would have played a great role as a veteran there. But unfortunately, that didn’t work and Dennis then joined the Dallas Mavericks while the Lakers went to three-peat. It’s surprising that he really had the two superstars in making worried about the attention.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“The girl’s like f**king crying” – Dennis Rodman narrates ‘wild graphics’ of how he BROKE his p*nis thrice during s*x</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-did-dennis-rodman-meet-jeanie-buss>How did Dennis Rodman meet Jeanie Buss?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_COM_20230711_2007_21_8591-1024x768.jpg><p>Dennis Rodman and Jeanie Buss dated for six months before parting ways. They still have a good relationship full of respect for each other. It all started when Jeanie Buss was 32 years old and posing for Playboy magazine. Rodman was even offered drinks at their first meet in a penthouse.</p><p>Revealing the story in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview</a>, Dennis Rodman said: “Jeanie Buss called me. Jeanie said ‘Dennis you want to go out to dinner?’ I said ‘Yeah why not.’ I’ve known Jeanie since she was in Playboy. So they put me up in the Ritz Carlton, in the penthouse, and she said ‘You wanna have some drinks?’ so we have some drinks. Of course…take if from there. So I start, this is a true story, I started dating Jeanie Buss. I dated her for six months.”</p><p>This story of Dennis Rodman though hasn’t been confirmed yet and Buss who also has been rumored to date many from the team is yet to confirm this. But Worm isn’t the guy who’d lie about such relationships and many even believe it to be true. As he really is a mysterious guy and has pulled even big shockers in the past.</p><p><strong>In Case You Missed It:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZuYZqaVrMBusMSnpaKrXae8pbnAp2SdmaSasW64wKScq6tdpMSvsdFmoZ6Znp6ybq7UrKpmoZ6bwrO1wK2gp59doLyjsYybqbKZnql6tLTAqqyipJyaerC6xJqjaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-frozen-custard.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Frozen Custard?
