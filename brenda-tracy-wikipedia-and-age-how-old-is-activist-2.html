Brenda Tracy is a survivor, campaigner, mother, and qualified nurse.</strong></p><p>The strength of Brenda Tracy is beyond words.</p><p>The mother of collegiate athlete Darius Adams talked about her experience with sexual assault on Thursday, August 23, during an emotional segment of ESPN’s Outside the Lines.</p><p>Activist Brenda Tracy founded the “Set the Expectation” pledge after surviving a rape. She presently does college visits to teach student-athletes about preventing sexual assault.</p><p>This incredible woman is honored on our Brenda Tracy Wiki. People’s curiosity has been peaked by Brenda Tracy’s Wikipedia details, so stick around to read more.</p><h2>Brenda Tracy How Old Is an Activist According to Wikipedia?</h2><p>Four college football players viciously raped Brenda in 1998 as part of a group. Soon after, she went to the hospital, made a police report, and prayed that justice would be done.</p><p>Unfortunately, as is often the case with these cases, that did not transpire. Police collected copious amounts of evidence, including confessions from her attackers, but the district attorney refused to prosecute her.</p><p>She was not informed of her victims’ rights when authorities destroyed her evidence three years ahead of the statute of limitations. Although her precise age is unknown, she may be in her 40s.</p><p>While her rapists went unpunished, Brenda carried on with her life, coping with the horrific event alone.</p><p>In 2014, she mustered the courage to speak up in public for the first time, and she is now striving to make the world a better place for survivors. Ever since her public debut, Brenda has advocated for legislation on behalf of victims.</p><p>She started the nonprofit organization Set The Expectation to inspire and enable men to become changemakers in their communities.</p><p>By her addresses to audiences across the country, she encourages a societal transformation to put an end to sexual abuse. Regarding Wikipedia, there is currently no mention of Brenda Tracy on the site.</p><h2>Brenda Tracy Son Darius: Who Is He?</h2><p>Tracy gave birth to her older son, Darius Adams when she was eighteen years old. Darius was five years old and his younger brother Devante was four years old when their mother was sexually abused.</p><p>At the time, Tracy was seeing a man who had recently graduated from Oregon State. He supported her the entire time, even though they eventually broke up.</p><p>Darius and Devante’s parents separated while they were young because of their father’s drug and alcohol problems, which occurred before Tracy’s attack.</p><p>For the majority of his life, Darius battled drug and alcohol abuse, suicidal thoughts, and unwarranted anger toward his mother.</p><p>Tracy tried to help her son, who had already finished his high school education. Darius wasn’t told about her sexual assault or his father’s violence until he was seventeen.</p><p>The events that befell his mother motivated him to turn his life around. Darius studied as hard as he could before he joined the basketball team. He carried on playing hoops in college.</p><p>Darius and Devante are involved members of the community, as is their mother. Together, they created the Change.org petition to implement the NCAA’s policy on sexual assault.</p><p>Mike Riley, their head coach, merely suspended two of the guys who had sexually abused her at the time for one game. The coach characterized their actions as a “bad choice.”</p><p>After Tracy’s account was included in a 2014 Oregonian piece about sexual assault on college campuses, Riley issued an apology to Tracy.</p><p>He offered his team a light punishment since he said he didn’t know all the details of what they had done. But his heartfelt apologies were much appreciated by Tracy.</p><p>After he transferred from Oregon State to the University of Nebraska, she was invited to speak to his athletes.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":36992,"10":2,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>campaigner</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Mother</a> <a href=# rel=tag>survivor</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Nigel Nelson Wikipedia And Age | Parents Siblings Ethnicity And Children</a></h3>Nigel Nelson is a well-known and adaptable person who has made a substantial impact on many different fields and left a lasting impression on society.
