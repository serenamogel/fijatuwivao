Therefore, his long alliance with the domain encouraged him to share meaningful insights and wisdom with the world through his own podcast venture post-retirement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In a recent Instagram post, Cutler opened up about an aspect of competing professionally in the iron-pumping world, about another esteemed bodybuilder, Derek Lunsford on Cutler Cast. Which truth was he talking about? Let’s find out.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Jay Cutler shared honest revelations.</b></h2><p><span>As per Cutler’s social media update on the 2nd of February, he shared a glimpse of his episode with the former 212 Mr. Olympia champion, Derek Lunsford. The 49-year-old athlete made honest speculations about Lunsford and the industry as a whole. He stated,&nbsp;</span><span>“Derek is not a guy that’s driven by money…yet.”&nbsp;</span><span>He competes in the Open division and was the runner-up in the 2022 Mr. Olympia. Moreover, his competing history is steadily reaching heights.</span></p><p><span>Emphasizing the role of monetary gains, Cutler implied that the 29-year-old competitor hasn’t been influenced by it, yet, but soon shall be. Additionally, the $30 million net worth bodybuilder aligned the thought with his career and revealed what many won’t. “</span><span>Once you start winning the big ones, unfortunately it is about the money. I experienced this,”&nbsp;</span><span>the pro disclosed.&nbsp;</span></p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-us-sports-new-bodybuilding-news-following-his-bodybuilding-rival-ronnie-colemans-footsteps-jay-cutler-reveals-a-special-surprise-for-50th-birthday?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/ronnie-coleman-jay-cutler-560x315.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Following His Bodybuilding Rival Ronnie Coleman’s Footsteps, Jay Cutler Reveals a Special Surprise for 50th Birthday</p></a><p><span>Furthermore, the post’s caption added,&nbsp;</span><span>“On not being motivated by money: They don’t have a taste of it yet. They might not be as motivated as us seasoned guys.”&nbsp;</span><span>Similarly, Cutler once opened up about difficult times when he had little money.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><b>Jay Cutler’s initial struggles</b></h2><p><span>In a 2022 interview, the retired bodybuilder&nbsp;</span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><span>unfolded his past struggles with money after he moved to California from Massachusetts.</span></a><span>&nbsp;“I remember I used to scrounge up change with $2 of gas in my truck just to drive,”</span><span>&nbsp;he stated. Apparently, he was mesmerized by the state’s beauty but was unable to cope with the expense of living there.</span></p><p>Evidently, training to be a pro-bodybuilder necessitated significant financial expenditures, which led to his monetary prejudices. He often ran out of gas since he was never able to fill up the tank. Even though he did not have money, he always made it to the gym anyhow.</p><p><strong>Watch this story:&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Six Bodybuilders Who Can Defeat 8-time Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman in Beast Like Structure</a></strong></p><p>Based on his past, financial gains were a consequential motivator for the athlete. Hence, it is quite explicit why Cutler conjectures on the aspect of money. With his dedication, he emerged as a legend in the industry and stands as an inspirational figure for young aspirants.
