King Von passed away on November 6, 2020. Tribute posts flooded social media. These came from listeners and of course, those who knew him personally. Lil Durk was one of the people who posted one. The caption he used referred to King Von as his “baby bro”. Listeners began to speculate if there was something deeper behind this. Lil Durk is an artist that had very close ties to him. Their relationship was strong outside the booth too.</p><p>King Von and Lil Durk were a very well-known pair in the Chicago rap music world. They did not have an official name as a duo. At least, not musically or one that was known by the general public. The two of them never officially dropped a collab project. Durk had been a figure in the Chicago music scene for years. Von’s come-up came after his but their come-up journeys were still aligned. They mostly stuck to the music but were also involved in serious criminal situations.<br></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-durk-king-von-have-had-criminal-charges>Lil Durk & King Von Have Had Criminal Charges</h2></span><p>ATL\Rapper King Von attends Compound Saturday Nights.(Photo by Prince Williams/Wireimage)</p><p>Their verses are a product of the things they grew up around. They have both shared many situations in their music that were a part of their upbringing. Many of these situations were still around them as adults. Multiple artists have spoken out against the type of music they made. The argument is that someone has to share their experiences with the world. Also, the situations happened in the past and they have moved past them. They did not want to encourage people to do the things they used to do.</p><p>Lil Durk and King Von were involved in a criminal case together. The situation was quite complex, but it resulted in the charges for Lil Durk being dropped. Before this, Lil Durk released an appropriately titled song “<a href=# rel>Turn Myself In</a>” that had multiple references to the situation. Also amidst the situation, King Von began handing out bundles of cash to residents of Chicago’s O’ Block area. They both handled the reality of the charges they faced differently. The situation brought more ears to their music and more attention to their social media too.</p><p>Many people commented “Slide for Von” on <a href=# rel>Lil Durk</a>’s posts after King Von passed. This meant they wanted Durk to get revenge for Von’s death. This is something many people had an issue with. It would only continue the cycle. Rappers have spoken about wanting this cycle to end. Durk responded to the comments in a line by saying the people were trolls. He did not want to jeopardize his career over revenge.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-long-musical-history>A Long Musical History</h2></span><p>Rapper Lil Durk performs during "One Big Party Tour".(photo by Prince Williams/Wireimage)</p><p>Durk and Von have been on multiple songs together. Lil Durk signed him to his label Only The Family in 2018. King Von’s first mixtape, Grandson, Vol. 1 had two appearances from Lil Durk on it. His first album, Welcome to O’Block, also had two appearances from Lil Durk. The Only The Family label released two projects and Durk and Von had a song together on the second one.King’s Von posthumous album, What It Means to be King, has one appearance from Lil Durk. His posthumous mixtape, Levon James, has two.</p><p>King Von has made appearances on projects from Lil Durk as well. The first one was on Lil Durk’s album Love Songs 4 The Streets 2. Another Only The Family album, Family Over Everything also has King Von on it. Lil Durk’s album, The Voice is credited as a tribute to King Von. The cover art has both of them on it. Additionally, it also has “Long Live Grandson” on the cover. As I previously mentioned, Grandson, Vol. 1, was the name of Von’s debut mixtape.</p><p>Lil Durk and King Von are not related. However, they are both from the same area of Chicago. Throughout the years, they have formed a strong bond. Often people will refer to each other as brothers because of this. The bond may not be blood but it feels like one. Sometimes, the older person in the relationship becomes a mentor. Lil Durk was older than King Von and a mentor of sorts to him. He helped him focus on his music.</p><p>Durk referred to Von as “baby bro” because of the relationship they had. Due to their similar music and lifestyle, he also called him his twin. This shows how he feels they mirrored each other. Von was someone Durk was able to uplift. He treated him like a brother. They were not related but family does not always involve blood.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaIJ5go9mo6KkXZnCs7eMpKCnn12rvK8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tommy-dorsey-net-worth-189396.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tommy Dorsey Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-benedict-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Benedict Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./latest-fantasy-news-a-peter-pan-wendy-stars-superman-near-miss-shocks-fans-as-viewers-plunge-into-a-bigger-and-bolder-new-season-of-sweet-tooth.html>Latest Fantasy News: A Peter Pan &amp;amp; Wendy stars Superman near-miss shocks fans as viewers pl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./roger-m-bobb-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Roger M.
