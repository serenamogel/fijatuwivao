Upon her appearance on the stage, she confessed that she hadn't performed live much and was nervous.</p><p class=Fg>She explained that she was trying to make music her career by putting herself out there and fighting the anxiety she got. Rios hoped her singing capabilities would finally free her from her dreaded pizza-making.</p><p class=Fg>The teenager had worked from morning until they closed at Pizza Hut for about a year because she was trying to afford her bills and other things. The youngster happened to reveal that she and her ex-boyfriend <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjVKWpp8Jh8">used to work together</a>, and when asked if she hoped he was watching, she hilariously disagreed.</p><p class=Fg>The spunky teenager said if her ex was watching, she wished he was doing well before taking the words back!
