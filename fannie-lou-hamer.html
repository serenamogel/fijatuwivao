She became involved with the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/sncc data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee</a> in 1962, through which she led voting drives and relief efforts. In 1964, she co-founded and ran for Congress as a member of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, drawing national attention to their cause at that year's Democratic Convention. Hamer continued her activism through declining health, until her death in 1977.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hamer was born Fannie Lou Townsend on October 6, 1917, in Montgomery County, Mississippi, the youngest of 20 children. Her parents were sharecroppers in the Mississippi Delta area, and Hamer began working in the fields when she was only 6 years old.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around the age of 12, Hamer dropped out of school in order to work full time and help out her family. She continued to work as a sharecropper after her 1944 marriage to Perry "Pap" Hamer. The couple toiled on a cotton plantation near Ruleville, Mississippi, eventually adopting children. Hamer was unable to have children of her own; while undergoing surgery to remove a tumor, she was given a hysterectomy without her consent.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Registering to Vote</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the summer of 1962, Hamer made a life-changing decision to attend a local meeting held by the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), who encouraged African Americans to register to vote. On August 31, 1962, she traveled with 17 others to the county courthouse in Indianola to accomplish this goal. They encountered opposition from local and state law enforcement along the way; only Hamer and one other person were allowed to fill out an application.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Such bravery came at a high price for Hamer. She was fired from her job and driven from the plantation she had called home for nearly two decades â€” just for registering to vote. But these actions only solidified Hamer's resolve to help other African Americans get the right to vote. According to The New York Times, she said "They kicked me off the plantation, they set me free. It's the best thing that could happen. Now I can work for my people."</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Joining the Civil Rights Movement</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hamer became a community organizer for the SNCC in 1962 and dedicated her life to the fight for civil rights. She spearheaded voter registration drives and relief efforts, but her involvement in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="civil rights movement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">civil rights movement</a> often left her in harm's way; during the course of her activist career, Hamer was threatened, arrested, beaten and shot at. In 1963, after she and other activists were arrested, she was beaten so badly in a Winona, Mississippi, jail that she suffered permanent kidney damage.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1964, Hamer helped found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), established in opposition to her state's all-white delegation to that year's Democratic Convention and announced her bid for Congress. Although she lost the Democratic primary, she brought the civil rights struggle in Mississippi to the attention of the entire nation during a televised session at the convention.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with her focus on voter registration, Hamer set up organizations to increase business opportunities for minorities and to provide childcare and other family services. She helped establish the National Women's Political Caucus in 1971.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death and Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Diagnosed with breast cancer in 1976, Fannie Hamer continued to fight for civil rights. She died on March 14, 1977, in a hospital in Mound Bayou, Mississippi.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hundreds crowded into a Ruleville church to say goodbye to this tireless champion for racial equality. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/andrew-young-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Andrew Young Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Andrew Young Jr.</a>, then a U.S. delegate to the United Nations, delivered a eulogy in which he declared that the progress of the civil rights movement had been made through "the sweat and blood" of activists like Hamer. "None of us would be where we are today had she not been here then," he said, according to The New York Times.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The activist is buried in the peaceful Fannie Lou Hamer Memorial Garden in Ruleville, beneath a tombstone engraved with one of her most famous quotes: "I am sick and tired of being sick and tired."</p><ul data-node-id=21 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Fannie Lou Hamer</li><li>Birth Year: 1917</li><li>Birth date: October 6, 1917</li><li>Birth State: Mississippi</li><li>Birth City: Montgomery County</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Fannie Lou Hamer was an African American civil rights activist who led voting drives and co-founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Civil Rights</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Libra</li><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Fannie Lou Hamer was the youngest of 20 children.</li><li>Fannie Lou Hamer was unable to have children after having a surgery to remove a tumor, and being given a hysterectomy without her consent.</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1977</li><li>Death date: March 14, 1977</li><li>Death State: Mississippi</li><li>Death City: Mound Bayou</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=26 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Fannie Lou Hamer Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/activists/fannie-lou-hamer</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: November 12, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=29 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>One day I know the struggle will change.
