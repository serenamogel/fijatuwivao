Segura was expecting a new deal for $17 million.</p><p>This means that the 32-year-old player who has been named to the All-Star team twice will become a free agent, and any club that might match his offer has a strong possibility of buying this outstanding talent for free since there will be no need to pay a transfer fee.</p><p>“The Phillies have exercised the club option on RHP Aaron Nola for the 2023 season. Additionally, the Phillies have declined the club option on INF Jean Segura.” the Philadelphia Phillies Twitter page wrote.</p><p>In the 2022 season, Segura was an essential cog in the team’s machine that helped them break their 11-year streak without making the playoffs. After the club declined his renewal offer, he is now a free agent and may sign with any team that he wants.</p><h2 id=jean-segura-contract-extension-2023-talk-with-phillies-is-over-no-deal-made><span class=ez-toc-section id=jean-segura-contract-extension-2023-talk-with-phillies-is-over-no-deal-made></span> Jean Segura Contract Extension 2023 Talk With Phillies Is Over, No Deal Made<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jean Segura became a free agent after the Phillies passed on his $17 million club contract option.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After all, Segura showed that he was one of the top receivers for the club in recent years, and the club chose to let him leave, which has caused a great deal of dissatisfaction among the club’s supporters.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A fan wrote on Twitter, “Will miss Jean Segura. Such an easy guy to root for.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On November 8, 2022, the Philadelphia Phillies decided&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>not to exercise the $17 million club option</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;held by Jean Segura for the 2023 season.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The two-time All-Star has been efficient throughout his time in Philadelphia and has successfully adjusted to playing second base after previously playing shortstop.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Because of his flexibility on defense in the 2020 season, he also played some third base. Thus, Segura has become essential to a club not known for its exceptional defensive prowess.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After being acquired in the trade that brought J.P. Crawford and Carlos Santana to Seattle, Segura has become an indispensable member of the Philadelphia Phillies. It seems likely that his time with the club has finally ended for good after four fantastic years.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The 32-year-old will not likely be playing for the Phillies next season unless he agrees to a pay cut which is not going to happen. After this, the Phillies will hand up a one million dollar buyout to Segura, and he will then be free to sign with any team. However, which team he will go to next is still undecided.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After it became clear that Segura’s time in Philadelphia ended, the issue of who would play second base in his stead now arose. However, with the abundance of free choices available for the infield position this off-season, the Phillies might be better served if they focused on acquiring another tremendous wide receiver.</span></p><h2 id=whats-next-for-jean-segura-probable-teams-after-phillies-turn-down><span class=ez-toc-section id=whats-next-for-jean-segura-probable-teams-after-phillies-turn-down></span> What’s Next For Jean Segura? Probable Teams After Phillies Turn Down<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As the Phillies turn down Jean Segura’s contract deal, there are probable teams within reach he could join next season.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>With the contract extension not likely to happen, the love story between Jean and the Philadelphia Phillies is over for good. After the $17 million club option deal went downhill, Jean became a free agent for the first time in his career.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Dominican shortstop should plan for what’s coming next and choose his desired club for the 2023 season. Jean, 32, has already played for five MLB clubs and has a dedicated fan base that is curious about whether or not he will return to any of his former teams.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2007, Segura became an Angel free agent and inked with the team. After making his debut in Major League Baseball with the Angels in 2012, he was later sent to the Brewers as part of a package for Zack Greinke.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After spending his whole career with the Brewers until 2015, the Diamondbacks acquired him in a transfer. After the conclusion of the 2016 campaign, Arizona sent him to Seattle, and in 2017, he inked a deal with the Mariners that was for $70 million over five years. After the conclusion of the 2018 campaign, Seattle made a deal with Philadelphia to acquire Segura.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Although he&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>wished to end his professional career at the Phillies</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, as he said before the final world series game against the Houston Astros, the fairy tale ending will not likely occur.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>About what his next destination will be, Jean said, “I’ll have to talk to my agents and see who wants me.” With such excellent and impressive stats, MLB teams would happily play him for their teams. Anywhere he goes, he will be an instant star.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>There is speculation that he might return to his previous club Milwaukee Brewers where he spent three seasons from 2012 to 2015. He came to the Brewers in 2012 after playing for a season at the Los Angeles Angels. He had a good time with the club back in the day, and Segura would also be happy to explore what remains of his old club.</span></p><h2 id=jean-segura-salary-assets-and-net-worth-in-2022><span class=ez-toc-section id=jean-segura-salary-assets-and-net-worth-in-2022></span> Jean Segura Salary, Assets And Net Worth In 2022 <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to Sportrac, Jean Segura earns an average salary of $14,000,000 a year, and his net worth is $46.2 million.</p><p>Jean Segura agreed to terms with the Seattle Mariners that would pay him $70,000,000 over five years in June 2017. The deal also includes a $3,000,000 signing bonus and $70,000,000 in guaranteed salary.</p><p>This agreement spans 2018 through 2022 and includes an alternative for $17 million for 2023 that may be bought out for $1 million. However, Segura was traded by the Mariners a year after the contract was made in 2018 to the Philadelphia Phillies.&nbsp;</p><p>In order for the transfer to go through, Segura nullified the no-trade provision that was included in his contract. Thus, it did not affect his contract and salary even if the club changed.&nbsp;</p><p>He earned an annual salary of $14,000,000 at the Phillies for three seasons. But the deal expires at the end of 2022, and when Segura activated a renewal club option contract extension of $17 million for the 2023 season, the Phillies declined his proposal.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=jean-segura-salary-and-contract></span>Jean Segura Salary And Contract<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table style=border-collapse:collapse;width:56.2767%;height:134.4px border=1><tbody><tr style=height:22.4px><td style=height:22.4px;text-align:center>Year</td><td style=height:22.4px;text-align:center>Team</td><td style=height:22.4px;text-align:center>Annual Salary</td></tr><tr style=height:22.4px;text-align:center><td style=height:22.4px>2017</td><td style=height:22.4px>Seattle Mariners</td><td style=height:22.4px>$6,200,000</td></tr><tr style=height:22.4px;text-align:center><td style=height:22.4px>2018</td><td style=height:22.4px>Seattle Mariners</td><td style=height:22.4px>$9,000,000</td></tr><tr style=height:22.4px;text-align:center><td style=height:22.4px>2019</td><td style=height:22.4px>Philadelphia Phillies</td><td style=height:22.4px>$14,000,000</td></tr><tr style=height:22.4px;text-align:center><td style=height:22.4px>2020</td><td style=height:22.4px>Philadelphia Phillies</td><td style=height:22.4px>$14,000,000</td></tr><tr style=height:22.4px;text-align:center><td style=height:22.4px>2021</td><td style=height:22.4px>Philadelphia Phillies</td><td style=height:22.4px>$14,000,000</td></tr><tr style=text-align:center><td>2022</td><td>Philadelphia Phillies</td><td>$14,000,000</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>2023</td><td style=text-align:center>Undecided</td><td style=text-align:center>$17,000,000 (club option)</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=jean-segura-assets-houses></span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jean Segura Assets & Houses&nbsp;</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2019, MLB star Jean Segura sold his mansion in Bellevue, WA, for $5 million.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He listed his 6,394-square-foot home up for sale.
