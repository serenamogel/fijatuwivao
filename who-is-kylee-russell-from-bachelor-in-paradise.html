Earning herself the first date card of the season, the North Carolina native asked Will to join her on a one-on-one excursion, enjoying a night under the stars with one another — how romantic is that?</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>Things took a turn when Aven stepped foot on the beach the next morning, bringing his own date card with him. Due to some flirtatiousness that occurred via social media prior to the show, Aven had his sights set on Kylee as soon as he arrived, bringing her on the date (and simultaneously shattering Will’s heart).</p><p data-characters=211 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>Discovering that her connection with Aven was stronger than her connection with Will after spending time with each of them individually, Kylee ended things with the latter, resulting in loads and loads of tears.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>The nurse has moved past the drama surrounding the oh-so complicated love triangle, and now things seem to be smooth sailing between Kylee and Aven. Could there be wedding bells in the future?</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>While we will just have to wait and see how the rest of their relationship unfolds, fans of The Bachelor franchise have many questions about who Kylee Russell is beyond the beach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kylee-Russell-Bachelor-In-Paradise-1.png><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>As far as the basics go, Kylee is 26 years old, currently working as a nurse in the Mother-Baby Postpartum unit at Atrium Health in Charlotte, North Carolina. She graduated from nursing school in December of 2021, announcing the news to her 40k followers on Instagram.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>While her life seems to be relatively normal, Kylee is so much more than meets the eye, serving as a member of the Charlotte Hornets dance team for nearly three years, serving as a contestant of the Miss North Carolina USA pageant, and more — is there anything she can’t do?</p><p data-characters=54 data-current-count=54 data-injectable=false>Her official bio for The Bachelor sums it up the best:</p><p>“Kylee may best be known as an NBA dancer, but this girl has way more going on than just her killer dance moves and beautiful smile! Outside of her love of dancing, Kylee is a registered nurse who works in a postpartum unit. She is passionate about helping new mothers and can’t wait to have a baby of her own ASAP. She may only be 25, but Kylee is ready for the soccer mom life, so hopefully Zach is on the same page! Kylee admits that she falls in love hard and fast, so time will tell if this hopeless romantic will be able to find her soulmate in Zach.”</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>While Zach did not end up being her soulmate (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he and Kaity Biggar are seriously as cute as can be</a>), Aven could end up being Kylee’s perfect match — only time will tell…</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>To watch their relationship continue to blossom, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tune into new episodes of Bachelor in Paradise&nbsp;every&nbsp;Thursday&nbsp;at 9pm ET/8pm CT on ABC, with new episodes available to stream on Hulu the next day</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlm665prGMq6ysq5WhuW6y0aikZpqRmLWmuM6rZKKmXaWus63DoqqeZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zeke-miller.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zeke Miller Associated Press, Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, MLK Bust, Salary, and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./this-is-elvis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>This Is Elvis | Rotten Tomatoes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./latest-fantasy-news-a-peter-pan-wendy-stars-superman-near-miss-shocks-fans-as-viewers-plunge-into-a-bigger-and-bolder-new-season-of-sweet-tooth.html>Latest Fantasy News: A Peter Pan &amp;amp; Wendy stars Superman near-miss shocks fans as viewers pl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./roger-m-bobb-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Roger M.
