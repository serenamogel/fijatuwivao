The hit show <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a></strong> is no different, and a little more difficult because it’s adapting a well-loved video game with the images of Ellie and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Joel</strong></a> burned into our collective heads.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Joel’s character in the show, while fundamentally the same as his video game counterpart, is also different in a lot of ways. He’s more openly afraid and not as brutal and forceful as he is in the game. Over on the The Last of Us <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">subreddit</a>, people have been debating those changes and how effective they’ve been.</p><p data-characters=125 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true><strong>Warning: Spoilers ahead for episode 5 of The Last of Us, called “The Ties That Bind,” and the rest of the series.</strong></p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>In the latest episode, we get a little more insight into Joel’s character (played by Pedro Pascal). He’s scared out of his wits and experiencing panic attacks because he’s realizing his feelings for Ellie and and he’s terrified of losing her the same way he lost his daughter.</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>A user on Reddit pointed this out and asked for other people’s opinions on the matter. Take a look at the post below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>HBO’s changes to Joel</a> from <a href=#>thelastofus</a></figure><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>The top comment is a pretty big spoiler for anyone who hasn’t played the game, but it’s worth sharing because it speaks to the contrast between Joel’s fear and what we all know is coming when they ultimately find the Fireflies and get to the hospital.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=160 data-injectable=false>“I still maintain the theory that he’s being portrayed as softer so that when we get to the hospital he goes apeshit,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">someone said</a>. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Others agree</a>.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>“Yep. We keep hearing about how bad he was, his reputation in the QZ (Robert is terrified of him), and this episode his monologue about how he’s weak, he’s not capable, he’s not who he used to be, he’s changed. We’re being blue balled into one of the most shocking scenes in TV for the new viewers, I think.”</p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=78 data-injectable=false>Someone else ironically referenced Game of Thrones, a show Pascal was also in.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>YungSnuggie’s comment from discussion "HBO’s changes to Joel"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>For those who know what’s coming, that comment makes 100 percent sense. It should be pointed out also that despite his crippling fear, he still managed to kill the raider at the University when he had to – in an especially grisly way as well.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Toadinboots’s comment from discussion "HBO’s changes to Joel"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>The consensus seems to be that Joel is much softer in the show, but that’s going to pay off all the more when they finally make it to that hospital scene.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>greatness101’s comment from discussion "HBO’s changes to Joel"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Well, whatever “full Batman” means it’s probably going to be intense regardless.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>bostonbedlam’s comment from discussion "HBO’s changes to Joel"</a>.</figure><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=159 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Another user pointed out</a> that game Joel uses violence as a practical necessity, and that TV Joel’s violence comes out when people he loves are in danger.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>“The show’s version of Joel is a bit different from the games. His capacity for violence isn’t necessarily a practical thing. It’s rooted in trauma, and comes out when people close to him are in danger. Whether the hospital scene is exactly the same as in the game or not, it’s almost certainly going to involve him murdering several people who don’t really deserve it without a second thought.”</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>OK, let’s summarize here. Game Joel kills because it’s a video game. TV Joel is a bit more nuanced and kills when he has to and is scared and more human. Also, that hospital scene we all know is coming is going to be really insane.</p><p data-characters=39 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>The Last of Us airs Sundays on HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylscGaq55lo6Wus7fSZpirp6WjsW6vx5qloJ2jYrqisMRmq6hlmqSyrb%2BMnJ%2BaqpGYwaa%2BjJ%2Bmq2WknbJuwNVmrZ6qo568r3nOn2StoJViuaK%2F02amn2WlqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./francois-botha.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Francois Botha</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zach-braff-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zach Braff Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./latest-fantasy-news-a-peter-pan-wendy-stars-superman-near-miss-shocks-fans-as-viewers-plunge-into-a-bigger-and-bolder-new-season-of-sweet-tooth.html>Latest Fantasy News: A Peter Pan &amp;amp; Wendy stars Superman near-miss shocks fans as viewers pl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./roger-m-bobb-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Roger M.
