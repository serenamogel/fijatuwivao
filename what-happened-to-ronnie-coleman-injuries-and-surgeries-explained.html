They stated, “he wanted to crack a grin and extend his hand.””</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=more-surgeries-to-come></span>More surgeries to come<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In September 2019, Coleman had his tenth surgery to repair four fractured screws (as in, those ones from 2018). “Say y’all please say a prayer for ya boy,” he wrote in an Instagram post.</p><p>Many of Coleman’s injuries were caused during his time in competitive bodybuilding. In 2004, he revealed that it was his third operation within a year. How much did those three surgeries cost? $2 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=coleman-back-in-hospital-in-2020></span>Coleman back in hospital in 2020<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A typical doctor’s visit in January 2020 to get x-rays on his hips turned into a “minor surgery” appointment.</p><p>In the video, Coleman says, “Here we go again. I’m on my way right now. You guys say a prayer for the old man.” Various publications have stated that Coleman is “crippled” and potentially “paralysed.”</p><p>However, he appeared to bounce back every time, including going to the gym “all alone” on Christmas Day in order to train.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=2020-%e2%80%98i-might-never-walk-again></span>2020: ‘I might never walk again’<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following that, in June 2020, Ronnie Coleman stated that he may never be able to walk again. He placed the blame for his condition at least in part on the surgeon who performed his most recent operation.</p><p>Ronnie says in a video interview with Ron Harris of Muscular Development that the cost of his three previous operations was prohibitive. He went on to say that, “if the surgeon had to perform these operations immediately, I would have been able to walk for a long time ago!”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-ronnie-coleman-bodybuilding-in-2022></span>Is Ronnie Coleman bodybuilding in 2022?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He can be seen training his leg muscles in one of Coleman’s most recent Instagram postings.
