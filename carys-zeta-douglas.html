Recently on July 19, 2020, she <a href=# rel=nofollow>posted</a> the photo of Carys wearing a white silk maxi gown in a garden with the caption: "My girl, in the garden".&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/7/21/75616136_567329457421165_7539222992112558162_n-1595325684489.jpg><p>Oscar-winning mom said that she is incredibly close to her kids, and very satisfied with them, too.
