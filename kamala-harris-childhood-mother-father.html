Her trailblazing career, which saw her become the first woman, the first Black and the first South Asian America elected vice president, has its roots in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/civil-rights-movement data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="civil rights movement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">civil rights movement</a> of the 1960s and 70s, and the family, friendships and communities that helped shape Harris’ life.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Harris’ parents traveled different, yet similar paths to the United States</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Harris' parents, Donald Harris and Shyamala Gopalan, were both born in 1938. Donald was the son of Afro-Jamaican parents, and he attended local schools before graduating from the University of the West Indies. He secured a prestigious scholarship to pursue advanced studies in economics and shocked his family and educators when he opted not to follow the path of previous scholarship recipients, who had remained within the sphere of the British Empire by studying in Britain. Instead, Donald applied to the University of California at Berkeley, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/us/kamala-harris-parents.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=fueled class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">fueled</a> by accounts of students from the university who had traveled to the Jim Crow South in the early days of the civil rights movement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shyamala was born in Madras, in what was then British India. Her senior civil servant father, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-10-25/how-kamala-harris-indian-family-shaped-her-political-career data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="P.V. Gopalan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">P.V. Gopalan</a>, was a member of the privileged, elite, ancient Tamil Brahmin caste, and her mother, Rajam, was a woman’s rights activist and proponent of increased access to birth control for Indian women. The Gopalans were progressive parents, instilling the importance of education for all their children.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Shyamala bristled at the limited education that she, like most other Indian women of the time, received, and after graduating from a woman’s college in New Delhi, she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/us/kamala-harris-parents.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="secretly applied" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">secretly applied</a> to Berkeley, despite the fact that her family had never visited the United States, let alone California. Her father was surprised but dug into his savings to fund her first year of school. She arrived on campus in 1958, two years before her future husband, to pursue her master’s degree in nutrition and endocrinology.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The pair met during an Afro-American Association meeting at Berkeley</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Soon after her arrival, Shyamala befriended several Black students and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/us/kamala-harris-parents.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=joined class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">joined</a> an off-campus reading group studying the overlooked works of Black authors. Later known as the Afro-American Association, its members included influential activists in the emerging Black consciousness movement, who would go on to establish the field of Black studies as well as the Kwanzaa holiday. Black Power and Black nationalist leaders were also members, including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/huey-p-newton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Huey P.

Newton</a>, a co-founder of the Black Panther Party.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was at a meeting in 1962 that she met Donald, and he was immediately taken with the petite (just 5-feet tall) yet confident Shyamala. The pair bonded over their shared left-wing politics and despite Shyamala’s original intention to return home to India after finishing school — and expectations that she would enter an arranged marriage — she and Donald married in 1963. Their first child, Kamala Devi, was born in Oakland in 1964, the same year Shyamala earned her PhD. Harris’ mother chose her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.politico.com/amp/news/magazine/2020/08/11/kamala-harris-vp-background-bio-biden-running-mate-2020-393885 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=name class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">name</a> in tribute to her Indian heritage. Kamala means “lotus,” and is also another name for Lakshmi, a Hindu goddess. Daughter Maya followed two years later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Harris would later <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/kamala-harris-2020-campaign/586033/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=recall class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">recall</a> in her autobiography and on the campaign trail that some of her first memories were of attending civil rights protests, giving her what she called a “stroller’s-eye” view of the movement.

Although Harris would later say that she rarely heard her parents arguing about their collapsing marriage, they had <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/us/kamala-harris-parents.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=become class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">become</a> like “oil and water.” Donald <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.jamaicaglobalonline.com/kamala-harris-jamaican-heritage/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=noted class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">noted</a> his anger at the family court system during a custody battle that he believed limited his parental rights.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite settling nearby after becoming the first Black economics professor at Stanford University, Donald became less of a constant presence in his daughters' lives, and their time with him was largely relegated to weekends, summer visits and trips to visit family in Jamaica.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Shyamala made sure her daughters embraced their multi-cultural background</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following the divorce, Shyamala and her daughters moved into a top-floor apartment in Oakland. As a young researcher, Shyamala worked long hours, often bringing Harris and her sister to the lab, or to a daycare center on the first floor of their building run by Regina Shelton, who <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/22/kamala-harris-makes-her-case data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=became class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">became</a> a “second mother” to the girls.

His lifelong dedication to civil rights for all would leave a deep impression on both Harris children.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Harris spent several formative years in Canada</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite the protective and supportive environment provided by friends in Oakland, Shyamala was disappointed at what she considered both sexist and racist attitudes that she believed had limited her scientific career. When Harris was 12, she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/world/canada/kamala-harris-montreal.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="moved the family" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">moved the family</a> to Montreal, accepting a researcher and teaching position at the Jewish General Hospital, where she would work for the next 16 years, making a number of breakthroughs in the early detection of breast cancer. She was remembered as a strict, but warm, parent, who even opened her home to a friend of Harris' who had suffered abuse at home.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Harris attended Westmount High School, one of the most ethnically diverse schools in Canada, and was a popular and well-liked student whose own multicultural background allowed her to slide easily among the school’s various ethnic groups. After graduating, Harris decided to attend Washington, D.C.’s Howard University, one of America’s most prestigious historically Black universities, before returning to California to study law.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shyamala was one of her daughter’s biggest supporters until her death from colon cancer in 2009, and Harris has credited all of her success to her mother. When Harris announced her presidential campaign on Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 2019, she went back to where both her story and those of her immigrant parents began — Oakland, California.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGinqKSZqbakrctmnaKfpaeytHvKmqSapJFitaK%2B0aKqZpuYnrmltM6om2aln6m1pr6Mn5itoJWn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./everything-about-doja-cats-relationship-with-deborah-elizabeth-sawyer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everything About Doja Cats Relationship With Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-many-movies-have-taraji-p-henson-and-tyler-perry-made-together.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How many movies have Taraji P.
