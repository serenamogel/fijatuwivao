These include smile lines, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>silver hairs</a>, and a loss in collagen. Defying age will never work — time will always win — however, there are treatments that can slow down the process should that be what you choose to do. Eva Longoria can tell you all about that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor, podcast host, and entrepreneur is all about getting help along the way. "Technology is insane now, so why not take advantage of it?" she tells InStyle over Zoom. She's right, of course. In-office cosmetic treatments have evolved in tenfold over the past years — if you never wanted to do a single crunch again in your life and still flaunt <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>chiseled abs</a>, you'd be able to.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Longoria learned about this a few years ago after giving birth to her son Santiago. She tells us that she didn't immediately dive into an intense workout routine postpartum, rather, she took her time. "After a couple years, I was in my groove and working out and eating right and sleeping well. I was doing everything you're supposed to be doing and I still had not the tightening on my stomach that I wanted, I felt like I had loose skin," she tells us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's when one of her friends told her about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>EvolveX</a>, a non-invasive treatment that uses radiofrequency to remodel skin, treat fat, and sculpt muscles. "It involved radiofrequency, waking up the collagen stimulation in my stomach, and telling my stomach to get taught again - really giving it that extra kick that it needed to do on its own," she tells us. "It contracted my muscles for me. And it did it in a deeper way than exercise can reach."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, she says she saw results within a week of her first treatment. When she first began getting EvolveX (which was after her son had turned three-years-old), she made three appointments one after the other. It worked quickly and effectively, so now, she only goes in when she wants a touch-up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After trying EvolveX, Longoria learned about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Morpheus8</a> — a treatment that uses radiofrequency and microneedling to target deep into the layers of the skin to remodel collagen.&nbsp;"That was the mother of all treatments," she raves. "It's a little more in-depth — it involves radiofrequency and microneedling to boost collagen in a deeper way. These treatments really helped remodel the skin on my stomach."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Morpheus8 involves microneedling, topical numbing is recommended. So, before going in-office to get the treatment, Longoria shares that she applies the numbing cream onto the areas of her stomach (where she gets treated) while at home, wraps that area in Saran wrap, makes breakfast for her son, then drives herself to the clinic after about an hour once the area is numb.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What she loves so much about EvolveX and Morpheus8 is that they came recommended by her friends — they weren't pitched to her. "I thought, 'Oh, okay. This is a mommy secret — I love it!'" she tells us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Obviously, postpartum journeys are different for everyone, and for Longoria this route felt right. "I didn't want the mommy makeover, I just needed a little tweak, a little help," she says. "So for me, the no down-time, it being non-invasive and almost painless — that's what really excited me."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Courtesy of InMode</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other things that have helped her feel like the best version of herself postpartum: her community and regular exercise. "Postpartum takes a village. if you look at the blue zones [areas of the world where people live longest] in the world, what they do well is they drink wine, have a Mediterranean diet, have a social circle. They're very social, and socialization is a big part of happiness," she begins. "My hour a day in the gym is my mental health hour because of the endorphins and energy I get for the rest of the day."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xK%2BYZqSfo7SwvsiaZKKmnaSxpnnIp6ueqqaesrh5lmpsbGpjbA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-do-you-unlock-a-leapfrog-watch.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How do you unlock a leapfrog watch</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./wild-bill-1995.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wild Bill movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1995)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./latest-fantasy-news-a-peter-pan-wendy-stars-superman-near-miss-shocks-fans-as-viewers-plunge-into-a-bigger-and-bolder-new-season-of-sweet-tooth.html>Latest Fantasy News: A Peter Pan &amp;amp; Wendy stars Superman near-miss shocks fans as viewers pl</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./roger-m-bobb-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Roger M.
